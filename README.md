This Python project focuses on analyzing the impact of COVID-19 around the world and how climate affects the number of cases and deaths. The project includes two datasets; one is climate.json, which contains information about climate factors such as temperature and humidity, and the other is worldpopulation.json, which includes information about the population of different countries and their geographical location. Additionally, there is a data file in CSV format named data.csv that contains COVID-19 data. This project is implemented using the Jupyter Notebook and its output is presented in finalproject.ipynb.

Dependencies:
The following libraries should be installed before running the project:

Pandas
Numpy
Matplotlib


Installation:
To install these libraries, you can use pip or conda package managers. For example, you can use the following command in the terminal to install the pandas library using pip:

pip install pandas

Dataset Description:
The project includes two datasets:

climate.json: This dataset contains information about the average temperature and humidity for different cities around the world for each month from 2010 to 2020.
worldpopulation.json: This dataset includes information about the population of different countries and their geographical location.
data.csv: This dataset contains COVID-19 data including the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries for each country and each day from January 2020 to the present.

Project Structure:
The project includes a Jupyter Notebook file named finalproject.ipynb. The notebook contains the following sections:

Data Loading: This section loads the datasets into the notebook using pandas library.
Data Cleaning: This section removes any missing or irrelevant data from the datasets.
Exploratory Data Analysis: This section includes various data visualization techniques to explore the data and find any patterns or trends.
Statistical Analysis: This section includes statistical methods to analyze the data and draw conclusions.

Conclusion: This section summarizes the findings from the analysis.

How to Run:
To run this project, follow these steps:

Install the required libraries.
Download the climate.json, worldpopulation.json, and data.csv files.
Open the Jupyter Notebook file finalproject.ipynb in a Jupyter environment.
Run each cell of the notebook in order.
